# 4b-adder-using-a-simple-half-adder
About developing Verilog modules for a 4b adder using a simple half-adder cell as building block. First we will write a Verilog module for a half adder and verify its functionality with test bench simulations. Then using that half-adder module, we will write the full-adder cell and verify its functionality with test bench simulations. Finally using that full adder module, we write the Verilog module for a 4b adder and verify its functionality. Before we write the modules, we need to understand how half adder and full adder works. When creating an adder, we have to design the incremental sub-systems in way that it can be re-used like using half adder to create full adder. This technique reduces the design effort, cost and minimizes the difficulty of troubleshooting. Half Adder computes the sum, S and carry out, C from its two input A and B. It is different from a Full adder because it doesnâ€™t take the carry-in bit into account. So for half adder the possible inputs are - 0+0 = 0 (0 is sum), 0+1 = 1, 1+0 = 1, and 1+1 = 10 (1 is Carry). As we can see, it only takes 2 inputs A, B so 2^2 = 4 possible combinations.
